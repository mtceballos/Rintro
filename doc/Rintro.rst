*First steps in R* does not pretend to be a comprehensive guide to R package
(there are many excellent books and web tutorials) but it aims at providing an
introduction to the R statistical package for the (under)graduate students
following an introductory Statistics Course.

**Why R?** 

Although many tools are available for statistical analysis (including SAS,
SPSS, Stata, Minitab, MATLAB, Wolfram Mathematica, among others), as well as
dedicated statistical packages for programming languages such as Python (see,
for example, `statsmodels <https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html>`_),
we have chosen R because:

* It is an **integrated environment**: it has been developed as a whole entity and not as a collection of tools. It includes:

  * An efficient system for data storage and manipulation

  * A collection of tools to manage arrays
  
  * Integrated tools for data analysis

  * Screen graphs and portable format graphs generation 
  
  * A simple and effective programming language (with *scripting* capabilities)

* It is **free software**! Available through the `project WEB <http://www.r-project.org>`_ or through `CRAN <http://cran.r-project.org>`_ (*Comprehensive R Archive Network*)

* Available for **different platforms** (source code and pre-compiled binaries): :t:`UNIX`, :t:`MacOS`, :t:`Windows`

* ...

* Many scientists are using it!
