R is an object-oriented language: an **object** in R is anything (constants, data structures, functions, graphs) that can be assigned to a variable:

* Data Objects: used to store real or complex numerical values, logical values or characters. These objects are always vectors: there are no scalars in R.

* Language Objects: functions, expressions

.. _datatypes:

Data structure types 
=====================

* :bblue:`Vectors`: one-dimensional arrays used to store collection data of the same mode

  * Numeric Vectors (mode: *numeric*)
  * Complex Vectors (mode: *complex*)
  * Logical Vectors (model: *logical*)
  * Character Vector or text strings (mode: character)

* :bblue:`Matrices`: two-dimensional arrays to store collections of data of the same mode. They are accessed by two integer indices.

* :bblue:`Arrays`: similar to matrices but they can be multi-dimensional (more than two dimensions)

* :bred:`Factors`: vectors of categorical variables designed to group the components of another vector with the same size
* :bblack:`Lists`: ordered collection of objects, where the elements can be of different types
* :bmagenta:`Data Frames`: generalization of matrices where different columns can store different mode data. 
* :bgreen:`Functions`: objects created by the user and reused to make specific operations.

:bblue:`Vectors`
-----------------

Numeric Vectors
****************

There are several ways to assign values to a variable:

::

  > a <- 1.7               # assign a value to a vector with only one element (~ scalar)
  > 1.7 -> a		   # assign a value to a vector with only one element (~ scalar)
  > a = 1.7                # assign a value to a vector with only one element (~ scalar)
  > assign("a", 1.7)	   # assign a value to a vector with only one element (~ scalar)

To show the values:

::

  > a			   # show the value in the screen (not valid in scripts)
  [1] 1.7
  > print(a)		   # show the value in the screen (valid in scripts)
  [1] 1.7

**Scalars** (i.e., individual numbers), do not really exist in R. 
What appear to be individual numbers are actually one-element vectors:

::

  > a[1]
  [1] 1.7
  
To generate a vector with several numeric values:

::

  > a <- c(10, 11, 15, 19) # assign four values to a vector using the concatenate command c()
  > a 			   # show the value in the screen 
  [1] 10 11 15 19
  
The operations are always done over all the elements of the numeric array:

::

  > a*a			   # evaluate the square value of every element in the vector
  [1] 100 121 225 361
  > 1/a			   # evaluate the inverse value of every element in the vector
  [1] 0.10000000 0.09090909 0.06666667 0.05263158
  > b <- a-1		   # subtract 1 from every element and assign the result to b
  > b
  [1]  9 10 14 18
  
To generate a *sequence*:

::

  > 2:10			        # generate a sequence from n1=2 to n2=10 using n1:n2
  [1]  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
  > 5:1				        # generate an inverse sequence if n2 < n1
  [1] 5 4 3 2 1
  
  > seq(from=n1, to=n2, by=n3) 		# generate sequence from n1 to n2 using n3 step
                                        #  (parameters names can be avoided if order is kept)
  > seq(from=1, to=10, by=3)
  [1]  1  4  7 10
  > seq(1, 10, 3)
  [1]  1  4  7 10
  
  > seq(length=10, from=1, by=3) 	# generate a fixed length sequence
  [1]  1  4  7 10 13 16 19 22 25 28
  
  > help(seq)				# for help about this command
  ...


To generate *repetitions*:

::

  > a <- 1:3; b <- rep(a, times=3); c <- rep(a, each=3)		# command rep()
  
In the previous example we have run three commands in the same line. They have been separated by a ';'. 

The content of the three variables is now:

::

  > a
  [1] 1 2 3
  > b
  [1] 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3
  > c
  [1] 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3
  
**The recycling rule:** vectors of different sizes can be combined, as far as
the length of the longer vector is a multiple of the shorter vector’s length
(otherwise a warning is issued, although the operation is carried out):

::

  > a+c                                         # proper dimensions
  [1] 2 3 4 3 4 5 4 5 6                         # (operation equivalent to b+c)

  > d <- c(10,100) 
  > b+d                                         # incorrect dimensions
  [1]  11 102  13 101  12 103  11 102  13
  Warning message:
  In b + d : longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object length

If we need to know which are the objects that are currently defined, we can *list* them:

::

  > ls()
  [1] "a" "b" "c" "d"
  
Undesired objects can be deleted using ``rm()`` function:

::

  > rm(a,c)				        # remove objects 'a' and 'b'
  > ls()				        # list current objects
  [1] "b" "d"
  

In order to remove everything in the working environment:

::

  > rm(list=ls())                               # Use this with caution
  > ls()                                        # (you'll receive no warning!)
  character(0)


.. _logicalVectors:
  
Logical Vectors
****************

::

  > a <- seq(1:10)				# generate a sequence
  > a
  [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10             # show values in screen
  > b <- (a>5)					# assign values from an inequality
  > b						# show values in screen
  [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE
  > a[b]					# show values that fulfil the condition
  [1]  6  7  8  9 10
  > a[a>5]					# the same, but avoiding intermediate variable
  [1]  6  7  8  9 10

.. _charVectors:  
  
Character Vectors
******************

::
  
  > a <- "This is an example"			# generate a character vector
  > a						# show vector content
  [1] "This is an example"
  
We can concatenate vectors after converting them into character vectors:

::

  > x <- 1.5
  > y <- -2.7
  > paste("Point is (",x,",",y,")", sep="")	# concatenate x, y and a string using 'paste' 
  [1] "Point is (1.5,-2.7)"

.. _matrices:

:bblue:`Matrices`
------------------
A matrix is a **bi-dimensional** collection of data:

::

  > a <- matrix(1:12, nrow=3, ncol=4)		# define a matrix with 3 rows and 4 columns
  > a                                                                                               
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]                                                                          
  [1,]    1    4    7   10                                                                          
  [2,]    2    5    8   11                                                                          
  [3,]    3    6    9   12  
  
  > dim(a)					# return matrix dimensions (rows,columns)
  [1] 3 4    
  
 
The elements of vectors and matrices are **recycled** when it is required by the involved dimensions:

::

  > a <- matrix(1:8, nrow=4, ncol=4)		# create a matrix with 4 rows and 4 columns
  > a
       [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
  [1,]    1    5    1    5
  [2,]    2    6    2    6
  [3,]    3    7    3    7
  [4,]    4    8    4    8
  
.. _arrays:

:bblue:`Arrays`
---------------

They are similar to the matrices although they can have 2 o more dimensions.

::

  > z <- array(1:24, dim=c(2,3,4))
  > z

.. _factors:

:bred:`Factors`
---------------

Factors are vectors that contain categorical information useful to group the values of other vectors of the same size.
Let's see an example:

::

  > bv <- c(0.92,0.97,0.87,0.91,0.92,1.04,0.91,0.94,0.96,
  +         0.90,0.96,0.86,0.85)   			# (B-V) colours from 13 galaxies
  
If additional information is available (for instance, the morphological type of the galaxies) we 
can create a **factor** containing the galaxy types:

::

  > morfo <- c("Sab","E","Sab","S0","E","E","S0","S0","E",
  +            "Sab","E","Sab","S0") 			# morphological info (same size)
  > length(morfo)					# ensure vector is the same size
  [1] 13
  > fmorfo <- factor(morfo)				# create factor with 'factor()'
  > fmorfo
  [1] Sab E   Sab S0  E   E   S0  S0  E   Sab E   Sab S0 	# show factor content
  Levels: E S0 Sab					# factor different values (levels)
  > levels(fmorfo)					# show factor levels
  [1] "E"   "S0"  "Sab"						

We could use this additional information to perform an statistical analysis segregating the data according 
to these types. This will be covered lately in the  :ref:`functions` section.

  
.. Now, we can calculate the mean values for each morphological type of the galaxies in the sample. 
.. For this purpose, we use the special function ``tapply()`` (more on this function in the :ref:`functions` section) 
.. which, according to *R Documentation*, "*Apply a function to each non-empty group 
.. of values given by a unique combination of the levels of certain factors*". The ``tapply()`` function requires 
.. the vector from which we want to calculate the colors in ``bv``, the associated factor ``fmorfo`` and the 
.. function that we want to evaluate (the mean, ``mean()``):

.. ::

..  > meanbv <- tapply(bv, fmorfo, mean)
..  > meanbv
..      E     S0    Sab 
..  0.9700 0.9025 0.8875 
  
.. Similarly it is possible to evaluate any other function (intrinsic from R or user-defined) segregating the 
.. data using the factor information. For example, the standard deviation can be calculated:

.. ::

..  > stbv <- tapply(bv,fmorfo,sd)
..  > stbv
.. 	  E         S0        Sab 
..  0.04358899 0.03774917 0.02753785 

  
  
.. _lists:

:bblack:`Lists`
---------------
Lists are ordered collections of objects, where the elements can be of a different type (a list can 
be a combination of matrices, vectors, other lists, etc.) They are created using the ``list()`` function:

::

  > gal <- list(name="NGC3379", morf="E", T.RC3=-5, colours=c(0.53,0.96))
  > gal
  $name                                                                                
  [1] "NGC3379"                                                                        
                                                                                     
  $morf                                                                                
  [1] "E"                                                                              
                                                                                     
  $T.RC3                                                                               
  [1] -5                                                                               
                                                                                     
  $colours                                                                             
  [1] 0.53 0.96                                                                        

  > gal$<Tab>			# pressing Tab key after '$', the elements of 'gal' are shown
  gal$name     gal$morf     gal$T.RC3    gal$colours
  
  > length(gal)			# check how many elements 'gal' has
  [1] 4
  
  > names(gal)          	# return element names
  [1] "name"    "morf"    "T.RC3"   "colours"

New elements can be added in a simple way, just defining them:

::

  > gal$radio <- TRUE				# add a boolean element
  > gal$redshift <- 0.002922			# add a numeric element
  
  > names(gal)					# return element names
  [1] "name"     "morf"     "T.RC3"    "colours"  "radio"    "redshift"

Lists can be concatenated to generate bigger lists. If we have ``list1``, ``list2``, ``list3``, we can create
a unique list which is the result of the union of these three lists:

::

  > list123 <- c(list1, list2, list3)
  
As the elements in a list can be R objects of a different type:

* :green:`Lists are extremely versatile since they can store every type of information (good)`
* :red:`Lists can be converted in objects with a rather complex structure (bad).` A list can contain several elements which are vectors of different length, which is similar to having a table where the columns have a different number of rows.
  
:blue:`The ideal situation is to take advantage of the list versatility but preventing them from growing with a very
complex structure. This is why R has defined a new type of data which fulfils both requirements: a` :bblue:`Data Frame.`
  
.. _dataframes:

:bmagenta:`Data Frames (Tables)`
--------------------------------

A *Data Frame* is an special type of list very useful for the statistical work. There are some restrictions to guarantee 
that they can be used for this statistical purpose.

Among other restrictions, a *Data Frame* must verify that:

* List components must be vectors (numeric, character or logical vectors), factors, numeric matrices or other data frames.
* Vectors, which are the variables in the data frame, must be of the same length.

.. warning:: 
  In a data frame, character vectors are automatically converted into factors for R < 4.0.0, and the number of levels can be 
  determined as the number of different values in such a vector. This default behaviour was modified for R 4.0.0. It can be changed with the 
  ``options(stringsAsFactors = TRUE/FALSE)`` command.

Basically, in a *Data Frame* all the information is displayed as a **table** where the columns have the 
same number of rows and can contain different type objects (numbers, characters, ...).
  
*Data Frames* can be created using the ``data.frame()`` function. Let's see how to define a *data frame* with 
two elements, a numeric vector and a character vector (note that both must be same length vectors):

::
 
  > options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
  > df <- data.frame(numbers=c(10,20,30,40),text=c("a","b","c","a"))
  > df
    numbers text
  1      10    a
  2      20    b
  3      30    c
  4      40    a
  > df$text					# character vector not converted to a factor
  [1] "a" "b" "c" "a"


  > options(stringsAsFactors = TRUE)		# default
  > df <- data.frame(numbers=c(10,20,30,40),text=c("a","b","c","a"))
  > df$text						
  [1] a b c a					# character vector of length = 4
  Levels: a b c					#  converted to a three levels factor!!  
  > df$numbers
  [1] 10 20 30 40				# numeric vector of length = 4
  
  > mode(df)					# storage mode of the object
  [1] "list"
  > typeof(df)					# (internal) storage mode of the object
  [1] "list"
  > class(df)					# object class
  [1] "data.frame"

However the most common way of defining a *data frame* is reading the data stored in a file. We will
see later how to do it using ``read.table()`` function.
  
  
.. _factorsTables:

Factors and Tables
*******************
It is frequently useful (for instance, for table creation) to be able to generate factors from a numeric 
continuum variable. To do so, we can use the ``cut`` command. Its parameter ``breaks`` defines how the data 
are divided. **If** ``breaks`` **is a number**, this is used as the number of (same length) intervals:

::

  > bv <- c(0.92,0.97,0.87,0.91,0.92,1.04,0.91,0.94,0.96,
  +         0.90,0.96,0.86,0.85)  		# (B-V) colors from 13 galaxies
  > fbv <- cut(bv,breaks=3)			# divide 'bv' in 3 equal-length intervals
  > fbv 					# show in which interval every galaxy is
  [1] (0.913,0.977] (0.913,0.977] (0.85,0.913]  (0.85,0.913]  (0.913,0.977]
  [6] (0.977,1.04]  (0.85,0.913]  (0.913,0.977] (0.913,0.977] (0.85,0.913] 
  [11] (0.913,0.977] (0.85,0.913]  (0.85,0.913] 
  Levels: (0.85,0.913] (0.913,0.977] (0.977,1.04]       # the 3 intervals
  > table(fbv)					# generate a table with the 3 intervals
  fbv
    (0.85,0.913] (0.913,0.977]  (0.977,1.04] 
            6             6             1 

**If** ``breaks`` **is a vector**, its values are used as the limits of the intervals:

::

  > ffbv <- cut(bv,breaks=c(0.80,0.90,1.00,1.10))
  > table(ffbv)
  ffbv
    (0.8,0.9]   (0.9,1]   (1,1.1] 
        4         8         1 

If we want just an approximate number of intervals, but with equally spaced *round* values, we can use the 
``pretty()`` function (that not always returns the specified number of intervals!):

::

  > fffbv <- cut(bv,pretty(bv,3))		# ask for 3 'pretty' intervals
  > table(fffbv)				# return 4 intervals
  fffbv
    (0.85,0.9] (0.9,0.95]   (0.95,1]   (1,1.05] 
         3          5          3          1 

We can also use a quantile division:

::

  > ffffbv <- cut(bv,quantile(bv,(0:4)/4))	# ask for the 4 quantiles
  > table(ffffbv)
  ffffbv
    (0.85,0.9]  (0.9,0.92] (0.92,0.96] (0.96,1.04] 
          3           4           3           2 

.. Warning:: The last two groupings exclude the value 0.85 which is one of our data values.


Factors can be used to build multi-dimensional tables. Let's see how.
First of all, we will define the data (that in a real case would be read from a data file):

::

  > heights <- c(1.64,1.76,1.79,1.65,1.68,1.65,1.86,1.82,1.73,
  +              1.75,1.59,1.87,1.73,1.57,1.63,1.71,1.68,1.73,1.53,1.82)
  > weights <- c(64,77,82,62,71,72,85,68,72,75,81,88,72,
  +              71,74,69,81,67,65,73)
  > ages <- c(12,34,23,53,23,12,53,38,83,28,28,58,38,
  +           63,72,44,33,27,32,38)
  
For each one of these variables we can generate factors:

::

  > fheights <- cut(heights,c(1.50,1.60,1.70,1.80,1.90))	# factor for 'heights'
  > fweights <- cut(weights,c(60,70,80,90))			# factor for 'weights'
  > fages    <- cut(ages,seq(10,90,10))				# factor for 'ages'
  
Table generation is now straightforward using these factors. We can, for instance, generate  bi-dimensional tables:

::

  > ta <- table(fheights, fweights)			# table for 'heights' vs. 'weights'
  > ta
             fweights
  fheights    (60,70] (70,80] (80,90]
    (1.5,1.6]       1       1       1
    (1.6,1.7]       2       3       1
    (1.7,1.8]       2       4       1
    (1.8,1.9]       1       1       2

Marginal frequencies can also be included:

::

  > addmargins(ta)
             fweights
  fheights    (60,70] (70,80] (80,90] Sum
    (1.5,1.6]       1       1       1   3
    (1.6,1.7]       2       3       1   6
    (1.7,1.8]       2       4       1   7
    (1.8,1.9]       1       1       2   4
    Sum             6       9       5  20

Or we can work with the relative frequencies;

::

  > tta <- prop.table(ta)
  > addmargins(tta)
           fweights
  fheights    (60,70] (70,80] (80,90]  Sum
    (1.5,1.6]    0.05    0.05    0.05 0.15
    (1.6,1.7]    0.10    0.15    0.05 0.30
    (1.7,1.8]    0.10    0.20    0.05 0.35
    (1.8,1.9]    0.05    0.05    0.10 0.20
    Sum          0.30    0.45    0.25 1.00

We can also generate tridimensional tables. Following the previous example, we can examine the same 
bi-dimensional table for each age interval:

::

  > table(fheights, fweights, fages)
  , , fages = (10,20]					# first age interval

           fweights
  fheights    (60,70] (70,80] (80,90]
    (1.5,1.6]       0       0       0
    (1.6,1.7]       1       1       0
    (1.7,1.8]       0       0       0
    (1.8,1.9]       0       0       0

  , , fages = (20,30]					# second age interval

           fweights
  fheights    (60,70] (70,80] (80,90]
    (1.5,1.6]       0       0       1
    (1.6,1.7]       0       1       0
    (1.7,1.8]       1       1       1
    (1.8,1.9]       0       0       0
    
  ........
  
  , , fages = (70,80]					# next-to-the-last age interval

           fweights
  fheights    (60,70] (70,80] (80,90]
    (1.5,1.6]       0       0       0
    (1.6,1.7]       0       1       0
    (1.7,1.8]       0       0       0
    (1.8,1.9]       0       0       0

  , , fages = (80,90]					# last age interval
  
           fweights
  fheights    (60,70] (70,80] (80,90]
    (1.5,1.6]       0       0       0
    (1.6,1.7]       0       0       0
    (1.7,1.8]       0       1       0
    (1.8,1.9]       0       0       0

  > sum(table(fheights, fweights, fages))		# check total number of entries
  [1] 20                
  

.. _matricesTables: 

Matrices and Tables
*******************
We can easily generate 2D tables from matrices:

::

  > mtab <- matrix(c(30,12,47,58,25,32), ncol=2, byrow=TRUE)  	# create a matrix filled by rows
  > colnames(mtab) <- c("ellipticals","spirals")		# set matrix column names 
  > rownames(mtab) <- c("sample1","sample2","new sample")	# set matrix row names
  > mtab
             ellipticals spirals
  sample1             30      12
  sample2             47      58
  new sample          25      32

However, ``mtab`` is not a true R table. To transform it into a true table we can use:

::
  
  > rtab <- as.table(mtab)
  
  > mode(mtab);mode(rtab)				# indistinguishable in 'mode'
  [1] "numeric"
  [1] "numeric"
  
  > typeof(mtab);typeof(rtab)				# indistinguishable in 'typeof'
  [1] "double"
  [1] "double"
  
  > class(mtab);class(rtab)				# but different in 'class' !
  [1] "matrix"		
  [1] "table"

In addition to the functions to calculate *marginal distributions* (``margin.table``), 
*frequencies* (``prop.table``), etc., the command ``summary`` returns the 
:math:`\chi^2` test for the independence of the factors:

::

  > summary(rtab)
  Number of cases in table: 204 
  Number of factors: 2 
  Test for independence of all factors:
	  Chisq = 9.726, df = 2, p-value = 0.007726
  
The same command returns a different result when it is applied to a matrix type object:

::

  > summary(mtab)
          V1             V2    
    Min.   :25.0   Min.   :12  
    1st Qu.:27.5   1st Qu.:22  
    Median :30.0   Median :32  
    Mean   :34.0   Mean   :34  
    3rd Qu.:38.5   3rd Qu.:45  
    Max.   :47.0   Max.   :58
  


.. _functions:

:bgreen:`Functions`
-------------------

These are objects that can be created by the user and then re-used to make specific operations.

.. admonition:: Why are functions important?
   :class: dropdown

   Functions are fundamental building blocks in R programming that allow you to
   encapsulate reusable code, making your programs more organized,
   maintainable, and efficient. Rather than writing the same code repeatedly,
   you can define a function once and call it whenever needed. This promotes
   the DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself) and makes it easier to update
   logic in one place rather than searching through your entire codebase.
   Functions also improve code readability by giving meaningful names to
   operations and help break down complex problems into smaller, manageable
   pieces.

   When defining a function in R, you specify formal parameters (also called
   formal arguments) in the function signature. These are placeholders that
   define what inputs the function expects to receive. For example, in the
   function definition

   ::

     > calculate_bmi <- function(weight, height) {
     +   weight / (height^2)
     + }

   the formal parameters are ``weight`` and ``height``. These are essentially
   variable names that will be used within the function body, but they don't
   have actual values until the function is called.

   When you call a function, you provide actual arguments (or actual parameters)
   that correspond to the formal parameters. These are the concrete values that
   get passed into the function. For instance, when you call

   ::

     > calculate_bmi(70, 1.75)
     [1] 22.85714

   the actual arguments are 70 and 1.75. At runtime, R binds these actual
   values to the formal parameters: ``weight`` becomes 70 and ``height``
   becomes 1.75 within that specific function execution. This distinction
   between formal and actual parameters is important because the formal
   parameters exist only as a template in the function definition, while actual
   arguments are the real data being processed.

   Default arguments provide a powerful way to make functions more flexible and
   user-friendly. When you assign a default value to a formal parameter in the
   function definition, that parameter becomes optional when calling the
   function.  For example, ``greet <- function(name, greeting = "Hello")``
   defines a function where ``greeting`` has a default value of "Hello". You
   can call this function as ``greet("Alice")``, and it will use the default
   greeting, or you can override it with ``greet("Alice", "Good morning")``.
   Default arguments are particularly useful for parameters that typically have
   a standard value but occasionally need to be changed, reducing the verbosity
   of function calls while maintaining flexibility. They also make functions
   backward-compatible when adding new parameters, since existing code that
   calls the function without the new parameter will continue to work using the
   defaults.

   **Variable scope**
   
   Variable scope in R determines where a variable can be accessed and modified
   within your code. R uses lexical scoping, which means that the availability
   of a variable depends on where it was defined in the structure of your code.

   When you create a variable inside a function, it exists only within that
   function's local environment and cannot be accessed from outside. This is
   called a local variable. For example, if you define ``x <- 10`` inside a
   function, that ``x`` is separate from any ``x`` that might exist in your
   global environment. When the function finishes executing, local variables
   are discarded.

   Variables defined outside of any function, in your main R session, are
   global variables. Functions can read global variables if no local variable
   with the same name exists. However, if you assign a value to a variable
   inside a function, R creates a new local variable rather than modifying the
   global one, unless you explicitly use the superassignment operator ``<<-``
   or the ``assign()`` function with specific parameters.

   R searches for variables following a hierarchical path: it first looks in
   the current local environment, then in the parent environment where the
   function was defined, continuing upward through enclosing environments until
   it reaches the global environment, and finally searches loaded packages.
   This nested environment structure means that inner functions can access
   variables from outer functions that enclose them.

   Understanding scope is crucial for avoiding bugs, particularly when variable
   names clash between different environments, and for writing functions that
   behave predictably without unintended side effects on global variables.

For example, we can define a **function** to calculate the standard deviation:

::

  > stddev <- function(x) {		        # user-defined function 'stddev'
  +   res = sqrt(sum((x-mean(x))^2) / (length(x)-1))
  +   return(res)
  + }

The ``+`` symbol appears in continuation lines when defining multiline
functions in the R console to indicate that R is waiting for additional input
to complete an incomplete expression, signaling that the command is not yet
finished and more code is expected before execution.

.. warning::

   Unlike Python, where indentation is syntactically significant and defines
   code blocks, R does not use indentation to determine program structure. In
   R, code blocks are delimited by curly braces ``{}``, and the interpreter
   completely ignores whitespace and indentation when parsing your code. This
   means you could write an entire function on a single line or use
   inconsistent indentation without causing syntax errors. However, while R
   doesn't enforce indentation, following consistent indentation conventions is
   still considered essential for code readability and maintainability. Proper
   indentation helps you and other programmers quickly understand the logical
   structure of your code, identify nested blocks, and spot errors more easily,
   even though the R interpreter itself pays no attention to it.

Functions can be defined inside other functions (nested) and can also be passed as arguments to other functions.
The value returned by a function is the result of the last expression evaluated in the body of the function or the 
value grabbed by the ``return`` command.

R functions arguments can have *default values* or can be *missing*. Arguments can be matched by name or position:

::

  > mynumbers <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
  > stddev(mynumbers)                           # equivalent calls to 'stddev'
  [1] 1.581139
  > stddev(x = mynumbers)
  [1] 1.581139
  
  > sd(x=mynumbers)				# R function using 'missing argument' with
  [1] 1.581139					#       default value (FALSE)
  > sd(x=mynumbers, na.rm=TRUE)			# Specify all arguments by name
  [1] 1.581139
  > sd(mynumbers, na.rm=TRUE)			# Mixing positional and by name matching
  [1] 1.581139  
  > sd(na.rm=TRUE, x=mynumbers)			# legal but not recommended (keep order)
  [1] 1.581139  

Looping Functions
******************
There are special R functions that can be used to repeat instructions in the command line and facilitate 
the programming process:
  
  * **lapply**: evaluate a function for each element of a list
  * **sapply**: evaluate a function for each element of a list *simplifying* the result
  * **apply**: Apply a function over the margins of an array (usually to apply a function to the rows/columns in a matrix)
  * **tapply**: Apply a function over subsets of a vector (for example defined with a factor)
  * **mapply**: Multivariate version of lapply
  
  
  
Let's see how to apply these functions to the previous example with the galaxy colours:

::

  > bv.vec <- c(0.92,0.97,0.87, 0.91,0.92,1.04,0.91,0.94,0.96,
  +             0.90,0.96,0.86,0.85)   				# (B-V) colours from 13 galaxies
  > morfo <- c("Sab","E","Sab","S0","E",  "E","S0","S0","E",	# ordered morph. information
  +            "Sab","E","Sab","S0")				#    for the galaxies
  
**lapply**  

::

  > bv.list <- list(colsSab=c(0.92,0.87,0.90,0.86), 
  +                 colsE=c(0.97,0.92,1.04,0.96,0.96), 
  +                 colsSO=c(0.91,0.91,0.94,0.85))
  
  > lapply(bv.list, mean)			# calculate mean for each galaxy type
  $colsSab                                      #    (returns a list)
  [1] 0.8875

  $colsE
  [1] 0.97

  $colsSO
  [1] 0.9025

**sapply**

::

  > sapply(bv.list, mean)			# simplified version of 'lapply'
  colsSab   colsE  colsSO                       #    (returns a vector)
  0.8875  0.9700  0.9025 

  
**tapply**  

::
  
  > fmorfo <- factor(morfo)			# create factor
  > tapply(bv,fmorfo,mean)			# apply mean function to the galaxy colours
       E     S0    Sab 				#    segregating by morphological type
  0.9700 0.9025 0.8875 

**apply**

::

  > a <- matrix(1:12, nrow=3, ncol=4)		# define a matrix with 3 rows and 4 columns
  > a                                                                                               
       [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
  [1,]    1    4    7   10
  [2,]    2    5    8   11
  [3,]    3    6    9   12
  
  > apply(a,1,mean)				# calculate rows ("1") mean == rowMeans
  [1] 5.5 6.5 7.5
  > rowMeans(a)
  [1] 5.5 6.5 7.5
  
  > apply(a,1,sum)				# calculate rows ("1") sum == rowSums
  [1] 22 26 30
  > rowSums(a)
  [1] 22 26 30

  > apply(a,2,mean)				# calculate columns ("2") mean == colMeans
  [1]  2  5  8 11
  > apply(a,2,sum)				# calculate columns ("2") sum == colSums
  [1]  6 15 24 33
  


.. _specialValues:

Special Values
==============
It is useful to define some values as * Not Available* (*NA*):

::

  > a <- c(0:2, NA, NA, 5:7)			# define vector with NA values
  > a						# show values in screen
  [1]  0  1  2 NA NA  5  6  7

We can carry out mathematical operations:

::

  > a*a						# calculate the square of 'a'
  [1]  0  1  4 NA NA 25 36 49
  
We can check whether there is any undefined value:

::

  > unavail <- is.na(a)				# use of is.na() function
  > unavail
  [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE
  
  
Sometimes calculations end up in values with no mathematical sense:

::

  > a <- log(-1)
  > a 
  [1] NaN					# Result is Not-a-Number (NaN)
  > a <- 1/0; b <- 0/0; c <- log(0); d <- c(a,b,c)
  > d
  [1]  Inf  NaN -Inf				# Infinities and Not-a-Number
  > 1/Inf 					# Possible to operate with Infinite
  [1] 0                                         #   (if it makes sense!)

To check whether we have *Infinite* values or *Not-a-Number* values:

::
  
  > is.infinite(d)				# is there any Infinite value?
  [1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE
  > is.nan(d)					# is there any Not-a-Number value?
  [1] FALSE  TRUE FALSE

Main R functions (``mean``, ``var``, ``sum``, ``min``, ``max``,...)  accept an argument called ``na.rm`` 
that can be set as ``TRUE`` or ``FALSE`` to remove (or not) the unavailable data.

::

  > a <- c(0:2, NA, NA, 5:7)			# define vector 'a' with Not-Available data
  > a 
  [1]  0  1  2 NA NA  5  6  7
  > mean(a)					# since there are Not-Available data
  [1] NA
  
  > mean(a, na.rm=TRUE)				# calculate mean, ignoring Not-Available values
  [1] 3.5


.. subsetting:

Subsetting
===========

Several R operators can be used to extract subsets (slices) from R objects:

* **[** can be used to extract **one or more elements** of an R object. It always returns an object of the same class
* **[[** can be used to extract a **single** element from a data frame or a list. The class of the extracted element can be different from the original object.
* **$** can be used to extract **named** elements from a data frame or a list.




For *Numeric Vectors*:

::

  > a <- 1:15				# generate a sequence
  > a <- a*a				# calculate the square of 'a'
  > a					# show in screen
  [1]   1   4   9  16  25  36  49  64  81 100 121 144 169 196 225
  > a[3]				# access to the third value in the vector
  [1] 9					#  (numeric index)	
  > a[3:5]				# access to a continuum slice of values
  [1]  9 16 25				#  (numeric index)
  > a[c(1,3,10)]			# access to a given sequence of values
  [1]   1   9 100			#  (numeric index)
  > a[-1]                               # negative index remove values from vector
  [1]   4   9  16  25  36  49  64  81 100 121 144 169 196 225
  > a[c(-1,-3,-5,-7)]                   # remove several values (it is not possible
  [1]   4  16  36  64  81 100 121 144 169 196 225   to mix positive and negative indices!)
  > a[a>100]				# access to a sequence based on a condition
  [1] 121 144 169 196 225		#  (logical index)


For *Character Vectors*:
 
::

  > a <- c("A", "B", "C", "C", "D", "E")
  > a[1]				# first element of "a" (also a character vector)
  [1] "A"				#  (numeric index)
  > a[1:4]				# sequence of the first 4 elements
  [1] "A" "B" "C" "C"
  > a[a>"C"]				# select elements "greater" than letter "C"
 [1] "D" "E"				#  (logical index)
  > gtC <- a > "C"			# the same but using an intermediate logical vector
  > gtC
  [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE
  > a[gtC]
  [1] "D" "E"
  
For *Matrices*, elements are accessed through two integer indices:

.. note:: The agreement to establish the indices order ``a[i,j]`` is the same than the one used in Math for the matrix coefficients a :sub:`ij`

::

  > a <- matrix(1:12, nrow=3, ncol=4)	# define a matrix with 3 rows and 4 columns
  > a                                  		                                        
       [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]                                     
  [1,]    1    4    7   10
  [2,]    2    5    8   11
  [3,]    3    6    9   12
   
  
  > a[2,3]				# return the value in the 2nd row and 3th column
  [1] 8
  > a[[2,3]]				# return the value in the 2nd row and 3th column
  [1] 8
  > a[2,]				# return the values for the second row
  [1]  2  5  8 11
  > a[,3]				# return the values for the third column
  [1] 7 8 9 

.. note:: By default, subsetting a single element or a single row or a single column returns a vector, not a matrix (this can be changed using ``drop=FALSE``)

::
    
  > a[2,3, drop=FALSE]			# so as not to 'drop' the dimension
        [,1]				#     (returns a 1x1 matrix)
  [1,]    8
  > a[2, , drop=FALSE]			# return a 1x4 matrix
        [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
  [1,]    2    5    8   11
  
  
The access to the matrix elements can be done with the indices stored in other auxiliary matrices:

::

For *lists*:  
  

The list components can be accessed using the three operators mentioned above (*[*, *[[* and *$*):

::

  > gal <- list(name="NGC3379", morf="E", colours=c(0.53,0.96))
  
  > gal[3]				# access to the third element of the list
  $colours                              #  (get back a list with one element called 'colours' 
  [1] 0.53 0.96                         #   with the sequence '0.53,0.96')
  > gal["colours"]			# single bracket + name (same as above)
  $colours				
  [1] 0.53 0.96

  > gal[[3]]				# access to the third element of the list
  [1] 0.53 0.96				#  (get back just the sequence)
  > gal[["colours"]]			# double bracket + name (same as above)
  [1] 0.53 0.96				
  
  
  > gal$colours				# element associated with the name 'colours'
  [1] 0.53 0.96				#  (same as double bracket)
  > gal$colours[1]			# first element of the sequence in the third element
  [1] 0.53
  > gal$colours[2]			# second element of the sequence in the third element
  [1] 0.96

To extract **multiple elements** of a list, single bracket is mandatory:

::

  > gal <- list(name="NGC3379", morf="E", colours=c(0.53,0.96))
  
  > gal[c(1,2)]				# return a list with the elements 'name' and 'morf'
  $name
  [1] "NGC3379"

  $morf
  [1] "E"

For **computed** indices the *[[* and *[* operators can be used. The *$* operator can only be used with *literal* names:

::

  > gal <- list(name="NGC3379", morf="E", colours=c(0.53,0.96))
  
  > info <- "morf"			# variable containing the name of one of the list elements
  
  > gal[["morf"]
  [1] "E"  
  > gal[[info]]				# computed index for 'morf' with double bracket
  [1] "E"
  
  > gal["morf"]
  $morf
  [1] "E"
  > gal[info]				# computed index for 'morf' with single bracket
  $morf
  [1] "E"
  
  > gal$morf
  [1] "E"
  > gal$info				# element 'info' unknown
  NULL

To **recursively** extract an element:

::

  > gal <- list(name="NGC3379", morf="E", colours=c(0.53,0.96))
  
  > gal[[c(3,1)]]			# extract the 1st element of the 3rd element ('0.53')
  [1] 0.53
  > gal[[3]][[1]]			# equivalent double subsetting
  [1] 0.53
  
  > gal[c(3,1)]				# not recursive!
  $colours
  [1] 0.53 0.96

  $name
  [1] "NGC3379"

Elements can be extracted using **partial matching** with the *[[* and *$* operators:

::

    > gal <- list(name="NGC3379", morf="E", colours=c(0.53,0.96))
     
    > gal$na				# get element by partial matching the name
    [1] "NGC3379"
    > gal[["na"]]			# expect exact element name
    NULL
    > gal[["na", exact=FALSE]]		# partial matching as with '$'
    [1] "NGC3379"


For *Data Frames (Tables)*, the operators used for slicing are the same than those used for *lists*:

For *Character Strings* the access to their elements is done in a different way:

::

  > a <- "This is an example of a text string"	# define a character string
  > substr(a,5,10)				# show a string subset
  [1] " is an"

  
.. rmNA:

Removing NA values
------------------
  
We can remove *Not Available* values in a simple way using subsetting:

::

  > a <- c(0:2, NA, NA, 5:7)			# define vector with NA values

  > aa <- a[!is.na(a)]				# the condition uses the negation
  > aa 						#    of is.na() function
  [1] 0 1 2 5 6 7                               # new vector with no NA values

To take the subset of multiple vectors avoiding the missing values:

::

  > a <- c( 1,  2, 3, NA, 5, NA, 7)
  > b <- c("A","B",NA,"D",NA,"E","F")
  > valsok <- complete.cases(a,b)		# return positions in which both vectors have 
  > valsok					#    no-missing values
  [1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE
  > a[valsok]					# subsetting 'a' gets good elements in 'a'
  [1] 1 2 7
  > b[valsok]					# subsetting 'b' gets good elements in 'b'
  [1] "A" "B" "F"

We can also use the function ``complete.cases`` to remove missing values from data frames:

::

  > airquality 					# data frame in R library
  > airquality[1:7, ]				# display first 7 rows of data frame
    Ozone Solar.R Wind Temp Month Day		# there are missing values in rows 5 and 6

  3    12     149 12.6   74     5   3
  4    18     313 11.5   62     5   4
  5    NA      NA 14.3   56     5   5
  6    28      NA 14.9   66     5   6
  7    23     299  8.6   65     5   7
  
  > valsok <- complete.cases(airquality)	# rows in which all the values are ok
  > airquality[valsok, ][1:7,]			# subset original dataframe and show first 7 rows
